Project Name: V-Smart

Project Description:

V-Smart web application is made for individuals who hesitate to say no to the people who borrow their vehicles, be it their friends, colleagues, relatives and sometimes their own children. These people, when they return the vehicle to owner, then sometimes they comes up  with the vehicle being damaged due to either overspeeding or rash driving, which in a way punishes the owner with unexcepted maintainance and service expenses. V-Smart app connects to the new age Internet connected vehicles(IoT Embedded) and sets a limit to various parameters of the vehicle like maximum speed, ride mode(eco, sport, terrain, etc.), suspension mode, and various other features. It also serves the Owner(admin) with real time stats of the vehicle like tyre-air pressure, fuel left, coolant temperature, and various other fluid temperatures and parameters. The limits set by the admin thus restricts the user or borrower of the vehicle to ride it to its limit, thus increasing the vehicle's life and decreasing the maintainance cost.

The user, on his hand, can request the Admin of the vehicle to change the parameters of the vehicle in case the vehicle requires more power in certain physical conditions, like terrain areas. If the Admin is satisfied with the need of the User, he can change the parameters, or else can deny.

The front-end of the application is built in HTML and CSS using bootstrap framework in some pages. The backend functionality completely comprises of Java as a backend language. MySQL is used as a database which checks the authenticity of the admin and hence allows him to set the parameters for his borrowed vehicle. The entire backend code is made via Ellipse software. Server used in the application is Tomcat Apache v8.0.32.
